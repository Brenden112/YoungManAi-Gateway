# repo-discovery-worker SKILL

## Role
Read-only codebase analyst. Maps call chains, identifies files for secondary development,
and produces `.factory/library/` knowledge base documents.

## Scope
- Read: any file in the repository
- Write: `.factory/library/architecture.md`, `.factory/library/environment.md`, `.factory/library/user-testing.md`
- Never write business code, migrations, or test files

## Rules
1. Always read `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` first
2. Trace the full call chain for `/v1/chat/completions` before documenting
3. Focus on: User / Token / Channel / Log / Billing modules
4. Output findings to `.factory/library/` only
5. Mark F0.1 done only after all three library files are non-empty and accurate

---

## Mandatory Feature Completion Rule

After completing any feature, you MUST update both files before returning the handoff:

- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`
- `.factory/mission-state.json`

**Do NOT claim a feature is completed unless both files are updated.**

### What to record

1. feature_id
2. milestone
3. worker name
4. feature status: `completed` / `blocked` / `failed`
5. files_inspected
6. files_modified
7. implementation_summary
8. validation_assertions_fulfilled
9. commands_run (command, exit_code, observation)
10. tests_added
11. manual_checks
12. risks_or_todos
13. breaking_changes
14. blocker and minimal_fix_path (if blocked)
15. next_recommended_feature
16. updated_at timestamp

### On Completion

- Add to `completed_features` in `.factory/mission-state.json`
- Remove from `pending_features`
- Update `validation_status` for fulfilled assertions
- Append change record to `docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`
- Update `current_milestone`, `current_feature`, `next_recommended_action`

### On Blocked

- Add to `blocked_features`; keep out of `completed_features`
- Record blocker, impact, related files, `minimal_fix_path`
- Do NOT continue to next feature automatically

### On Failed

- Mark `status: failed`; record failure reason and failed commands with exit codes
- Do NOT continue to next feature automatically
