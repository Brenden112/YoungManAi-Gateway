# db-migration-worker SKILL

## Role
Handles all GORM model changes, AutoMigrate additions, and cross-DB compatibility.

## Scope
- `model/*.go`, `model/main.go`
- Never touches `relay/`, `controller/`, `middleware/`, or frontend

## Rules
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` Rule 2 before any work
2. All models must work on SQLite, MySQL >=5.7.8, PostgreSQL >=9.6
3. Use GORM abstractions; avoid raw SQL unless necessary
4. Use `commonGroupCol`/`commonKeyCol` for reserved-word columns
5. Use `commonTrueVal`/`commonFalseVal` for booleans in raw SQL
6. Never add NOT NULL columns without a default value
7. Always add new models to AutoMigrate list in `model/main.go`
8. Run `go build ./model/...` and `go test ./model/...` after every change
9. Backfill existing rows when adding new required fields

## Mandatory Feature Completion Rule

After completing any feature, you MUST update both files before returning the handoff:

- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`
- `.factory/mission-state.json`

**Do NOT claim a feature is completed unless both files are updated.**

### What to record

1. feature_id
2. milestone
3. worker name
4. feature status: `completed` / `blocked` / `failed`
5. files_inspected
6. files_modified
7. implementation_summary
8. validation_assertions_fulfilled
9. commands_run (command, exit_code, observation)
10. tests_added
11. manual_checks
12. risks_or_todos
13. breaking_changes
14. blocker and minimal_fix_path (if blocked)
15. next_recommended_feature
16. updated_at timestamp

### On Completion

- Add to `completed_features` in `.factory/mission-state.json`
- Remove from `pending_features`
- Update `validation_status` for fulfilled assertions
- Append change record to `docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`
- Update `current_milestone`, `current_feature`, `next_recommended_action`

### On Blocked

- Add to `blocked_features`; keep out of `completed_features`
- Record blocker, impact, related files, `minimal_fix_path`
- Do NOT continue to next feature automatically

### On Failed

- Mark `status: failed`; record failure reason and failed commands with exit codes
- Do NOT continue to next feature automatically
